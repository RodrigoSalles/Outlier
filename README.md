# Outlier - The point outside the curve
Short study on outliers: types, causes, detection process, effects on regression models, treatment. 

Note: This study was done a few years ago. Some things could be done differently. We are always learning and improving. It remains as a record of my evolution process.. :-)

## General Information
- This small study is associated with an article published on the blog [Ensina-ai](https://medium.com/ensina-ai). The article can be found [here](https://medium.com/ensina-ai/outlier-o-ponto-fora-da-curva-1f28f3d9c23).

- The work presents the types of outliers and their main causes, their effects on machine learning models, detection method and treatment of anomalous values found.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8.8


## Effect of outliers
* Effects of the presence of outliers in the dataset used.
  * Regression on dataset without outliers: MAE = 29.88

  * Regression on dataset with outliers: MAE = 152.15

## Setup
* To run the notebook just have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Project Status
* This small study is closed.


## Room for Improvement
* The effects of outliers could be evaluated in other regression models.
* Other ways of detecting outliers could be evaluated.
