## General Information
- This small study is associated with an article published on the blog [Ensina-ai](https://medium.com/ensina-ai). The article can be found [here](https://medium.com/ensina-ai/outlier-o-ponto-fora-da-curva-1f28f3d9c23).

- The work presents the types of outliers and their main causes, their effects on machine learning models, detection method and treatment of anomalous values found.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8.8


## Effect of outliers
* Effect of the presence of dataset outliers
  * Regression on dataset without outliers:
